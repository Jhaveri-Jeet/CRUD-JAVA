This repository contains a basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application implemented using JSP, HTML, servlets, and AJAX. It serves as a practical example of building a web application with a Java-based backend and a dynamic frontend.

## Features

- **Create**: Add new records to your application.
- **Read**: Display and retrieve existing records.
- **Update**: Modify and update records.
- **Delete**: Remove records from your database.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**:

  - HTML
  - JSP (JavaServer Pages)
  - AJAX for asynchronous communication with the backend

- **Backend**:
  - Java Servlets
  - MySQL or your preferred database system

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   ```

2. **Database Setup**:

   - Create a MySQL database or use your preferred database system.
   - Configure the database connection in the servlet code.

3. **Configure AJAX Calls**:

   - Ensure the AJAX calls in your frontend code (JSP and HTML) point to the correct API endpoints in your servlets.

4. **Run the Application**:

   - Deploy your project on a servlet container like Apache Tomcat or your preferred container.
   - Access the application through your web browser.

5. **Requiremnets**:

   - mysql-connector-j-8.0.32.jar
   - JDK 19
   - Apache Tomcat or TomEE
